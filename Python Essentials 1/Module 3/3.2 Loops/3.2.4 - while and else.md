### The `while` loop and the `else` branch

Both loops, `while` and `for`, have one interesting (and rarely used) feature.

We'll show you how it works - try to judge for yourself if it's usable and whether you can live without it or not.

In other words, try to convince yourself if the feature is valuable and useful, or is just syntactic sugar.

Take a look at the snippet in the editor. There's something strange at the end - the `else` keyword.

As you may have suspected, **loops may have the** `else` **branch too, like** `if`**s**.

The loop's `else` branch is **always executed once, regardless of whether the loop has entered its body or not.**

Can you guess the output? Run the program to check if you were right.

```python
i = 1
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("else:", i)
```

```
1

4
else: 5
```
</details>

Modify the snippet a bit so that the loop has no chance to execute its body even once:

```python
i = 5
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("else:", i)
```

The `while`'s condition is `False` at the beginning - can you see it?

Run and test the program, and check whether the `else` branch has been executed or not.
