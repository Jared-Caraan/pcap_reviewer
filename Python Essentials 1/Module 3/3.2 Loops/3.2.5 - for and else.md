### The `for` loop and the `else` branch

`for` loops behave a bit differently - take a look at the snippet in the editor and run it.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("else:", i)
```

The output may be a bit surprising.

The `i` variable retains its last value.

Modify the code a bit to carry out one more experiment.

```python
i = 111
for i in range(2, 1):
    print(i)
else:
    print("else:", i)
```

Can you guess the output?

The loop's body won't be executed here at all. Note: we've assigned the `i` variable before the loop.

Run the program and check its output.

When the loop's body isn't executed, the control variable retains the value it had before the loop.

> [!NOTE]
> **If the control variable doesn't exist before the loop starts, it won't exist when the execution reaches the** `else` **branch.**

How do you feel about this variant of `else`?

Now we're going to tell you about some other kinds of variables. Our current variables can only **store one value at a time**, but there are variables that can do much more - they can **store as many values as you want**.
