### Slices - negative indices

Look at the snippet below:

`my_list[start:end]`

To repeat:

- `start` is the index of the first element **included in the slice**;
- `end` is the index of the first element **not included in the slice**.

This is how **negative indices** work with the slice:

```python
my_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
new_list = my_list[1:-1]
print(new_list)
```

The snippet's output is:

`[8, 6, 4]`

If the `start` specifies an element lying further than the one described by the `end` (from the list's beginning point of view), the slice will be **empty**:

```python
my_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
new_list = my_list[-1:1]
print(new_list)
```

The snippet's output is:

`[]`
