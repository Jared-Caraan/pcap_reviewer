### The `in` and `not in` operators

Python offers two very powerful operators, able to **look through the list in order to check whether a specific value is stored inside the list or not**.

These operators are:

```python
elem in my_list
elem not in my_list
```

The first of them (`in`) checks if a given element (its left argument) is currently stored somewhere inside the list (the right argument) - the operator returns `True` in this case.

The second (`not in`) checks if a given element (its left argument) is absent in a list - the operator returns `True` in this case.

Look at the code in the editor. The snippet shows both operators in action. Can you guess its output? Run the program to check if you were right.

```python
my_list = [0, 3, 12, 8, 2]

print(5 in my_list)
print(5 not in my_list)
print(12 in my_list)
```
