### Slices: continued

If you omit the `start` in your slice, it is assumed that you want to get a slice beginning at the element with index `0`.

In other words, the slice of this form:

`my_list[:end]`

is a more compact equivalent of:

`my_list[0:end]`

Look at the snippet below:

```python
my_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
new_list = my_list[:3]
print(new_list)
```

This is why its output is:` [10, 8, 6]`.

Similarly, if you omit the `end` in your slice, it is assumed that you want the slice to end at the element with the index `len(my_list)`.

In other words, the slice of this form:

`my_list[start:]`

is a more compact equivalent of:

`my_list[start:len(my_list)]`

Look at the following snippet:

```python
my_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
new_list = my_list[3:]
print(new_list)
```

Its output is therefore: `[4, 2]`.

### Slices: continued

As we've said before, omitting both `start` and `end` makes a **copy of the whole list**:

```python
my_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
new_list = my_list[:]
print(new_list)
```

The snippet's output is: `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.

The previously described `del` instruction is able to **delete more than just a list's element at once - it can delete slices too**:

```python
my_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
del my_list[1:3]
print(my_list)
```

> [!NOTE]
> in this case, the slice **doesn't produce any new list**!

The snippet's output is: `[10, 4, 2]`.
