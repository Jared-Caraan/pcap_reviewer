### Lists in action

Let's leave lists aside for a short moment and look at one intriguing issue.

Imagine that you need to rearrange the elements of a list, i.e., reverse the order of the elements: the first and the fifth as well as the second and fourth elements will be swapped. The third one will remain untouched.

Question: how can you swap the values of two variables?

Take a look at the snippet:

```
variable_1 = 1
variable_2 = 2

variable_2 = variable_1
variable_1 = variable_2
```

If you do something like this, you would **lose the value previously stored** in `variable_2`. Changing the order of the assignments will not help. You need a **third variable that serves as an auxiliary storage**.

This is how you can do it:

```
variable_1 = 1
variable_2 = 2

auxiliary = variable_1
variable_1 = variable_2
variable_2 = auxiliary
```

Python offers a more convenient way of doing the swap - take a look:

```
variable_1 = 1
variable_2 = 2

variable_1, variable_2 = variable_2, variable_1
```

Clear, effective and elegant - isn't it?
