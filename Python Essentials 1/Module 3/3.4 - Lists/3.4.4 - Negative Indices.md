### Negative indices are legal

It may look strange, but negative indices are legal, and can be very useful.

An element with an index equal to `-1` is **the last one in the list**.

```python
numbers = [111, 7, 2, 1]
print(numbers[-1])
print(numbers[-2])
```

The example snippet will output `1`. Run the program and check.

Similarly, the element with an index equal to `-2` is **the one before last in the list**.

`print(numbers[-2])`

The example snippet will output `2`.

The last accessible element in our list is `numbers[-4]` (the first one) - don't try to go any further!
