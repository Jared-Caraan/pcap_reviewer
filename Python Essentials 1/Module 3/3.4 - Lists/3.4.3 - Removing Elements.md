### Removing elements from a list

Any of the list's elements may be **removed** at any time - this is done with an instruction named `del` (delete). Note: it's an **instruction**, not a function.

You have to point to the element to be removed - it'll vanish from the list, and the list's length will be reduced by one.

Look at the snippet below. Can you guess what output it will produce? Run the program in the editor and check.

```python
numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
print("Original list content:", numbers)  # Printing original list content.

numbers[0] = 111
print("\nPrevious list content:", numbers)  # Printing previous list content.

numbers[1] = numbers[4]  # Copying value of the fifth element to the second.
print("Previous list content:", numbers)  # Printing previous list content.

print("\nList's length:", len(numbers))  # Printing previous list length.

###

del numbers[1]  # Removing the second element from the list.
print("New list's length:", len(numbers))  # Printing new list length.
print("\nNew list content:", numbers)  # Printing current list content.

```

Original list content: [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]

Previous list content: [111, 5, 7, 2, 1]
Previous list content: [111, 1, 7, 2, 1]

List's length: 5
New list's length: 4

New list content: [111, 7, 2, 1]

**You can't access an element which doesn't exist** - you can neither get its value nor assign it a value. Both of these instructions will cause runtime errors now:

```python
print(numbers[4])
numbers[4] = 1
```

Add the snippet above after the last line of code in the editor, run the program and check what happens.

Note: we've removed one of the list's elements - there are only four elements in the list now. This means that element number four doesn't exist.
