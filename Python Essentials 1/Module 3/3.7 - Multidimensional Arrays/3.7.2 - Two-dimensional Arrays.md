### Lists in lists: two-dimensional arrays

Let's also assume that a **predefined symbol** named `EMPTY` designates an empty field on the chessboard.

So, if we want to create a list of lists representing the whole chessboard, it may be done in the following way:

```python
board = []

for i in range(8):
    row = [EMPTY for i in range(8)]
    board.append(row)
```

Note:

- the inner part of the loop creates a row consisting of eight elements (each of them equal to `EMPTY`) and appends it to the `board` list;
- the outer part repeats it eight times;
- in total, the `board` list consists of 64 elements (all equal to `EMPTY`)

This model perfectly mimics the real chessboard, which is in fact an eight-element list of elements, all being single rows. Let's summarize our observations:

- the elements of the rows are fields, eight of them per row;
- the elements of the chessboard are rows, eight of them per chessboard.

The `board` variable is now a **two-dimensional array**. It's also called, by analogy to algebraic terms, a **matrix**.

### Lists in lists: two-dimensional arrays - continued

Access to the selected field of the board requires two indices - the first selects the row; the second - the field number inside the row, which is de facto a column number.

Take a look at the chessboard. Every field contains a pair of indices which should be given to access the field's content:

Glancing at the figure shown above, let's set some chess pieces on the board. First, let's add all the rooks:

```python
board[0][0] = ROOK
board[0][7] = ROOK
board[7][0] = ROOK
board[7][7] = ROOK
```

If you want to add a knight to C4, you do it as follows:

`board[4][2] = KNIGHT`

And now a pawn to E5:

`board[3][4] = PAWN`

And now - experiment with the code in the editor.

```python
EMPTY = "-"
ROOK = "ROOK"
board = []

for i in range(8):
    row = [EMPTY for i in range(8)]
    board.append(row)

board[0][0] = ROOK
board[0][7] = ROOK
board[7][0] = ROOK
board[7][7] = ROOK

print(board)
```
