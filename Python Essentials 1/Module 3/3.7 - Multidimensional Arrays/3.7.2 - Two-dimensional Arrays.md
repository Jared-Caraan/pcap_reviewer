### Lists in lists: two-dimensional arrays

Let's also assume that a **predefined symbol** named `EMPTY` designates an empty field on the chessboard.

So, if we want to create a list of lists representing the whole chessboard, it may be done in the following way:

```python
board = []

for i in range(8):
    row = [EMPTY for i in range(8)]
    board.append(row)
```

Note:

- the inner part of the loop creates a row consisting of eight elements (each of them equal to `EMPTY`) and appends it to the `board` list;
- the outer part repeats it eight times;
- in total, the `board` list consists of 64 elements (all equal to `EMPTY`)

This model perfectly mimics the real chessboard, which is in fact an eight-element list of elements, all being single rows. Let's summarize our observations:

- the elements of the rows are fields, eight of them per row;
- the elements of the chessboard are rows, eight of them per chessboard.

The `board` variable is now a **two-dimensional array**. It's also called, by analogy to algebraic terms, a **matrix**.
