### The bubble sort

Now that you can effectively juggle the elements of lists, it's time to learn how to **sort** them. Many sorting algorithms have been invented so far, which differ a lot in speed, as well as in complexity. We are going to show you a very simple algorithm, easy to understand, but unfortunately not too efficient, either. It's used very rarely, and certainly not for large and extensive lists.

Let's say that a list can be sorted in two ways:

- increasing (or more precisely - non-decreasing) - if in every pair of adjacent elements, the former element is not greater than the latter;
- decreasing (or more precisely - non-increasing) - if in every pair of adjacent elements, the former element is not less than the latter.

In the following sections, we'll sort the list in increasing order, so that the numbers will be ordered from the smallest to the largest.
