### Boolean values

To conclude with Python's literals, there are two additional ones.

They're not as obvious as any of the previous ones, as they're used to represent a very abstract value - **truthfulness**.

Each time you ask Python if one number is greater than another, the question results in the creation of some specific data - a **Boolean** value.

The name comes from George Boole (1815-1864), the author of the fundamental work, _The Laws of Thought_, which contains the definition of **Boolean algebra** - a part of algebra which makes use of only two distinct values: `True` and `False`, denoted as `1` and `0`.

A programmer writes a program, and the program asks questions. Python executes the program, and provides the answers. The program must be able to react according to the received answers.

Fortunately, computers know only two kinds of answers:

- Yes, this is true;
- No, this is false.

You'll never get a response like: _I don't know_ or _Probably yes, but I don't know for sure_.

Python, then, is a **binary** reptile.

These two Boolean values have strict denotations in Python:

```python
True
False
```

You cannot change anything - you have to take these symbols as they are, including **case-sensitivity**.

Challenge: What will be the output of the following snippet of code?

```python
print(True > False)
print(True < False)
```
