### Operators and their priorities

So far, we've treated each operator as if it had no connection with the others. Obviously, such an ideal and simple situation is a rarity in real programming.

Also, you will very often find more than one operator in one expression, and then this presumption is no longer so obvious.

Consider the following expression:

`2 + 3 * 5`

You probably remember from school that **multiplications precede additions**.

You surely remember that you should first multiply 3 by 5 and, keeping the 15 in your memory, then add it to 2, thus getting the result of 17.

The phenomenon that causes some operators to act before others is known as **the hierarchy of priorities**.

Python precisely defines the priorities of all operators, and assumes that operators of a larger (higher) priority perform their operations before the operators of a lower priority.

So, if you know that `*` has a higher priority than `+`, the computation of the final result should be obvious.

### Operators and their bindings

The **binding** of the operator determines the order of computations performed by some operators with equal priority, put side by side in one expression.

Most of Python's operators have left-sided binding, which means that the calculation of the expression is conducted from left to right.

This simple example will show you how it works. Take a look:

`print(9 % 6 % 2)`

There are two possible ways of evaluating this expression:

- from left to right: first `9 % 6` gives `3`, and then `3 % 2` gives `1`;
- from right to left: first `6 % 2` gives `0`, and then `9 % 0` causes **a fatal error**.

Run the example and see what you get.

The result should be `1`. This operator has **left-sided binding**. But there's one interesting exception.

### Operators and their bindings: exponentiation

Repeat the experiment, but now with exponentiation.

Use this snippet of code:

`print(2 ** 2 ** 3)`

The two possible results are:

- `2 ** 2` → `4`; `4 ** 3` → `64`
- `2 ** 3` → `8`; `2 ** 8` → `256`

Run the code. What do you see?
`256`

The result clearly shows that **the exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding**.
<hr>

### List of priorities

Since you're new to Python operators, we don't want to present the complete list of operator priorities right now.

Instead, we'll show you a truncated form, and we'll expand it consistently as we introduce new operators.

Look at the table below:

> [!NOTE]
> we've enumerated the operators in order **from the highest (1) to the lowest (4) priorities**.

Try to work through the following expression:

`print(2 * 3 % 5)`

Both operators (`*` and `%`) have the same priority, so the result can be guessed only when you know the binding direction. What do you think? What is the result?

Answer: `1`

### Operators and parentheses

Of course, you're always allowed to use **parentheses**, which can change the natural order of a calculation.

In accordance with the arithmetic rules, s**ubexpressions in parentheses are always calculated first**.

You can use as many parentheses as you need, and they're often used to **improve the readability** of an expression, even if they don't change the order of the operations.

An example of an expression with multiple parentheses is here:

`print((5 * ((25 % 13) + 100) / (2 * 13)) // 2)`

Try to compute the value that's printed to the console. What's the result of the print() function?

Answer: `10.0`
