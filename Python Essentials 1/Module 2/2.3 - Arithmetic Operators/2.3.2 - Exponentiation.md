### Arithmetic operators: exponentiation

A `**` (double asterisk) sign is an **exponentiation** (power) operator. Its left argument is the **base**, its right, the **exponent**.

Classical mathematics prefers notation with superscripts, just like this: **2<sup>3</sup>**. Pure text editors don't accept that, so Python uses `**` instead, e.g., `2 ** 3`.

Take a look at our examples:

```python
print(2 ** 3)
print(2 ** 3.)
print(2. ** 3)
print(2. ** 3.)
```

> [!NOTE]
> we've surrounded the double asterisks with spaces in our examples. It's not compulsory, but it improves the **readability** of the code.

The examples show a very important feature of virtually all Python **numerical operators**.

```shell
8
8.0
8.0
8.0
```

**Remember**: It's possible to formulate the following rules based on this result:

- when **both** `**` arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
- when **at least one** `**` argument is a float, the result is a float, too.

This is an important distinction to remember.
