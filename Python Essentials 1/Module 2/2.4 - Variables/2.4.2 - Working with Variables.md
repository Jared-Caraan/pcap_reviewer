### Creating Variables

What can you put inside a variable?

Anything.

You can use a variable to store any value of any of the already presented kinds, and many more of the ones we haven't shown you yet.

The value of a variable is what you have put into it. It can vary as often as you need or want. It can be an integer one moment, and a float a moment later, eventually becoming a string.

Let's talk now about two important things - **how variables are created**, and **how to put values inside them** (or rather - how to give or **pass values** to them).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A variable comes into existence as a result of assigning a value to it**. Unlike in other languages, you don't need to declare it in any special way.<br><br>
> If you assign any value to a nonexistent variable, the variable will be **automatically created**. You don't need to do anything else.<br><br>
> The creation (or otherwise - its syntax) is extremely simple: **just use the name of the desired variable, then the equal sign (=) and the value you want to put into the variable**.

Take a look at the snippet:

```python
var = 1
print(var)
```

It consists of two simple instructions:

- The first of them creates a variable named `var`, and assigns a literal with an integer value equal to `1`.
- The second prints the value of the newly created variable to the console.

Note: `print()` has yet another side to it - it can handle variables too. Do you know what the output of the snippet will be?

### Using variables

You're allowed to use as many variable declarations as you need to achieve your goal, like this:

```python
var = 1
account_balance = 1000.0
client_name = 'John Doe'
print(var, account_balance, client_name)
print(var)
```

You're **not allowed to use a variable which doesn't exist** (in other words, a variable that was not assigned a value).

This example will **cause an error**:

```python
var = 1
print(Var)
```

We've tried to use a variable named `Var`, which doesn't have any value (note: `var` and `Var` are different entities, and have nothing in common as far as Python's concerned).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use the `print()` function and combine text and variables using the `+` operator to output strings and variables, e.g.:
> ```python
> var = "3.8.5"
> print("Python version: " + var)
> ```

Can you guess the output of the snippet above?
