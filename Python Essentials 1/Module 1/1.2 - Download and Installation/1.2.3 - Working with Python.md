## Starting your work with Python

Now that you have Python 3 installed, it's time to check if it works and make the very first use of it.

This will be a very simple procedure, but it should be enough to convince you that the Python environment is complete and functional.

There are many ways of utilizing Python, especially if you're going to be a Python developer.

To start your work, you need the following tools:

- an **editor** which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features, not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;
- a **console** in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when it gets out of control;
- a tool named a **debugger**, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you to inspect it at each moment of execution.

Besides its many useful components, the Python 3 standard installation contains a very simple but extremely useful application named IDLE.

Navigate through your OS menus, find IDLE somewhere under Python 3.x and launch it. This is what you should see:
