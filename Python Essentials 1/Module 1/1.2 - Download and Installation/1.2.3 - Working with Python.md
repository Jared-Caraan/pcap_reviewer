## Starting your work with Python

Now that you have Python 3 installed, it's time to check if it works and make the very first use of it.

This will be a very simple procedure, but it should be enough to convince you that the Python environment is complete and functional.

There are many ways of utilizing Python, especially if you're going to be a Python developer.

To start your work, you need the following tools:

- an **editor** which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features, not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;
- a **console** in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when it gets out of control;
- a tool named a **debugger**, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you to inspect it at each moment of execution.

Besides its many useful components, the Python 3 standard installation contains a very simple but extremely useful application named IDLE.

Navigate through your OS menus, find IDLE somewhere under Python 3.x and launch it. This is what you should see:

### How to write and run your very first program

It is now time to write and run your first Python 3 program. It will be very simple, for now.

The first step is to create a new source file and fill it with code. Click _File_ in the IDLE menu and choose _New file_.

As you can see, IDLE opens a new window for you. You can use it to write and amend your code.

This is the **editor window**. Its only purpose is to be a workplace in which your source code is treated. Do not confuse the editor window with the shell window. They perform different functions.

The editor window is currently untitled, but it's good practice to start work by naming the source file.

Click _File_ (in the new window), then click _Save as..._, select a folder for the new file (the desktop is a good place for your first programming attempts) and chose a name for the new file.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't set any extension for the file name you are going to use. Python needs its files to have the _.py_ extension, so you should rely on the dialog window's defaults. Using the standard .py extension enables the OS to properly open these files.

### How to write and run your very first program
Now put just one line into your newly opened and named editor window.

The line looks like this:

```python
print("Hisssssss...")
```

You can use the clipboard to copy the text into the file.

We're not going to explain the meaning of the program right now. You'll find a detailed discussion in the next chapter.

Take a closer look at the quotation marks. These are the simplest form of quotation marks (neutral, straight, dumb, etc.) commonly used in source files. Do not try to use typographic quotes (curved, curly, smart, etc.), used by advanced text processors, as Python doesn’t accept them.

Save the file (_File -> Save_) and run the program (_Run -> Run Module_).

If everything goes okay and there are no mistakes in the code, the console window will show you the effects caused by running the program.

In this case, the program **hisses**.

Try to run it once again. And once more.

Now close both windows now and return to the desktop.
