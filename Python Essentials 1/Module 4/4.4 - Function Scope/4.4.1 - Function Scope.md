### Functions and scopes

Let's start with a definition:

The **scope of a name** (e.g., a variable name) is the part of a code where the name is properly recognizable.

For example, the scope of a function's parameter is the function itself. The parameter is inaccessible outside the function.


Let's check it. Look at the code in the editor. What will happen when you run it?

```python
def scope_test():
    x = 123


scope_test()
print(x)
```

The program will fail when run. The error message will read:

`NameError: name 'x' is not defined`

This is to be expected.

We're going to conduct some experiments with you to show you how Python constructs scopes, and how you can use its habits to your benefit.
