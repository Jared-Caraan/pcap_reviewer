### A few words about `None`

Let us introduce you to a very curious value (to be honest, a none value) named `None`.

Its data doesn't represent any reasonable value - actually, it's not a value at all; hence, it **mustn't take part in any expressions**.

For example, a snippet like this:

```python
print(None + 2)
```

will cause a runtime error, described by the following diagnostic message:

`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`

> [!NOTE]
> `None` is a **keyword**.

There are only two kinds of circumstances when `None` can be safely used:

- when you **assign it to a variable** (or return it as a **function's result**)
- when you **compare it with a variable** to diagnose its internal state.

Just like here:

```python
value = None
if value is None:
    print("Sorry, you don't carry any value")
```

### A few words about `None`: continued

Take a look at the code in the editor.

```python
def strange_function(n):
    if(n % 2 == 0):
        return True
```

It's obvious that the `strangeFunction` function returns `True` when its argument is even.

What does it return otherwise?

We can use the following code to check it:

```python
print(strange_function(2))
print(strange_function(1))
```

This is what we see in the console:

```
True
None
```

Don't be surprised next time you see `None` as a function result - it may be the symptom of a subtle mistake inside the function.
