### Effects and results: the `return` instruction

All the previously presented functions have some kind of effect - they produce some text and send it to the console.

Of course, functions - like their mathematical siblings - may have results.

To get **functions to return a value** (but not only for this purpose) you use the return instruction.

This word gives you a full picture of its capabilities. Note: it's a Python **keyword**.

The `return` instruction has **two different variants** - let's consider them separately.
<hr>

### `return` without an expression

The first consists of the keyword itself, without anything following it.

When used inside a function, it causes the **immediate termination of the function's execution, and an instant return (hence the name) to the point of invocation**.

> [!NOTE]
> if a function is not intended to produce a result, **using the** `return` **instruction is not obligatory** - it will be executed implicitly at the end of the function.

Anyway, you can use it to **terminate a function's activities on demand**, before the control reaches the function's last line.
<hr>

Let's consider the following function:

```python
def happy_new_year(wishes = True):
    print("Three...")
    print("Two...")
    print("One...")
    if not wishes:
        return
    
    print("Happy New Year!")
```

When invoked without any arguments:

```python
happy_new_year()
```

The function causes a little noise - the output will look like this:

```
Three...
Two...
One...
Happy New Year!
```

Providing `False` as an argument:

```python
happy_new_year(False)
```

will modify the function's behavior - the `return` instruction will cause its termination just before the wishes - this is the updated output:

```
Three...
Two...
One...
```
<hr>

### `return` with an expression

The second `return` variant is **extended with an expression**:

```python
def function():
    return expression
```

There are two consequences of using it:

- it causes the **immediate termination of the function's execution** (nothing new compared to the first variant)
- moreover, the function will **evaluate the expression's value and will return (hence the name once again) it as the function's result**.

Yes, we already know - this example isn't really sophisticated:

```python
def boring_function():
    return 123

x = boring_function()

print("The boring_function has returned its result. It's:", x)
```

The snippet writes the following text to the console:

`The boring_function has returned its result. It's: 123`

Let's investigate it for a while.

Analyze the figure below:

The `return` instruction, enriched with the expression (the expression is very simple here), "transports" the expression's value to the place where the function has been invoked.

The result may be freely used here, e.g., to be assigned to a variable.

It may also be completely ignored and lost without a trace.

Note, we're not being too polite here - the function returns a value, and we ignore it (we don't use it in any way):

```python
def boring_function():
    print("'Boredom Mode' ON.")
    return 123

print("This lesson is interesting!")
boring_function()
print("This lesson is boring...")
```

The program produces the following output:

```
This lesson is interesting!
'Boredom Mode' ON.
This lesson is boring...
```
