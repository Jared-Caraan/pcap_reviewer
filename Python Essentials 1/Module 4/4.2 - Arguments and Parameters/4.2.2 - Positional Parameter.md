### Positional parameter passing

A technique which assigns the ith (first, second, and so on) argument to the ith (first, second, and so on) function parameter is called **positional parameter passing**, while arguments passed in this way are named **positional arguments**.

You've used it already, but Python can offer a lot more. We're going to tell you about it now.

```python
def my_function(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

my_function(1, 2, 3)
```

> [!NOTE]
> positional parameter passing is intuitively used by people in many social occasions. For example, it may be generally accepted that when we introduce ourselves we mention our first name(s) before our last name, e.g., "My name's John Doe."

Incidentally, Hungarians do it in reverse order.

Let's implement that social custom in Python. The following function will be responsible for introducing somebody:

```python
def introduction(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hello, my name is", first_name, last_name)

introduction("Luke", "Skywalker")
introduction("Jesse", "Quick")
introduction("Clark", "Kent")
```

Can you guess the output? Run the code and find out if you were right.

**Output**
```
Hello, my name is Luke Skywalker
Hello, my name is Jesse Quick
Hello, my name is Clark Kent
```

Now imagine that the same function is being used in Hungary. In this case, the code would look like this:

```python
def introduction(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hello, my name is", first_name, last_name)

introduction("Skywalker", "Luke")
introduction("Quick", "Jesse")
introduction("Kent", "Clark")
```

The output will look different. Can you guess it?

**Output**
```
Hello, my name is Skywalker Luke
Hello, my name is Quick Jesse
Hello, my name is Kent Clark
```

Run the code to see if you were right here, too. Are you surprised?

Can you make the function more culture-independent?
