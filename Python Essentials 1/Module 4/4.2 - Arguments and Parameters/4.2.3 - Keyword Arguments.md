### Keyword argument passing

Python offers another convention for passing arguments, where **the meaning of the argument is dictated by its name**, not by its position - it's called **keyword argument passing**.

Take a look at the snippet:

```python
def introduction(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hello, my name is", first_name, last_name)

introduction(first_name = "James", last_name = "Bond")
introduction(last_name = "Skywalker", first_name = "Luke")
```

The concept is clear - the values passed to the parameters are preceded by the target parameters' names, followed by the `=` sign.

The position doesn't matter here - each argument's value knows its destination on the basis of the name used.

You should be able to predict the output. Run the code to check if you were right.
<hr>

Of course, you **mustn't use a non-existent parameter name**.

The following snippet will cause a runtime error:

```python
def introduction(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hello, my name is", first_name, last_name)

introduction(surname="Skywalker", first_name="Luke")
```

This is what Python will tell you:

`TypeError: introduction() got an unexpected keyword argument 'surname'`

Try it out yourself.
