## Welcome to Python Essentials 1

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to **design**, **write**, **debug**, and **run** programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the **basic concepts of software development technology**.

The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood **software development**, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer **systems design** and **software testing**.
